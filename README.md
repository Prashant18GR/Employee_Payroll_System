Employee Payroll System
Employee Payroll System is a simple Java application for managing employee information, built using the Spring Boot framework. The system allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records.

Getting Started
To run the application, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd employee-payroll-system
Build and run the application using Maven:

The application will start, and you can access it at http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

Features
Create Employee: Add new employee records to the system.

Read Employee: Retrieve and display employee information based on their ID.

Update Employee: Modify existing employee records, including salary updates.

Delete Employee: Remove an employee from the system based on their ID.

Usage
The application includes a CommandLineRunner that demonstrates the basic functionality of the EmployeeDAO. It creates sample employee records, saves them to the database, reads, updates, and deletes them.
